# Josef Brechler
# Data science projects portfolio

Hi there, 

here you can find portfolio of several projects I have done mostly for fun, to educate myself and, well, to show what I am capable of working with. The projects are sorted chronologically, the newest projects being at the top.

## Deepdream exploration

**Notable technologies**

 - `TensorFlow`
 - `Convolutional neural networks (CNN)`
 
**Summary**

I had a lot of fun with this project. It is an extension to the [Deepdream notebook from Tensorflow tutorials](https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/blob/master/tensorflow/examples/tutorials/deepdream/deepdream.ipynb). I explore behaviour of the Google's pretrained Inception5h CNN in terms of parameters tweaking, applying layers' filters on own images as well as visualizing layers themselves.

 - [ipynb notebook](https://github.com/pepaczz/deepdream_exploration/blob/master/codes/deepdream_explor_20180403a.ipynb) - Due to a lot of visualizations the binary is rather large (16 MB) and reloading might be necessary to show it in GitHub. If problems prevail please download the html and open it on your computer. It is worth it!
